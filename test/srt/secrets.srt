1
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
<i>Long ago,
the plains of East Africa</i>

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
<i>were home to our distant ancestors.</i>

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,080
<i>For reasons lost to time,
some of these ancestors</i>

4
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>decided to leave and headed north</i>

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,080
<i>to become the Neanderthals.</i>

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,960
<i>Over time their numbers grew.</i>

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>Their territories stretching from Russia
to the Atlantic Coast.</i>

8
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,480
{\an8}<i>Small clans roaming
across this vast wilderness.</i>

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,040
<i>Surviving against the odds
for over 300,000 years</i>

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,200
<i>until, suddenly,</i>

11
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,480
<i>they disappeared.</i>

12
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,200
{\an8}<i>Only in a few places,
have their remains survived,</i>

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>and one of the most significant</i>

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,960
<i>is found in the Middle East,</i>

15
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,040
<i>an archaeological treasure trove</i>

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,080
{\an8}<i>hidden deep in the mountains
of Kurdistan,</i>

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,960
{\an8}<i>Shanidar Cave.</i>

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
The Shanidar Cave

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,800
is regarded as one
of the most revered caves in the world

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,840
during the time of the Neanderthals
and Homo Sapiens.

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,640
In a place where life
has been ever present,

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,640
we might find answers to questions.

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,240
Questions that are still mysterious.

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
<i>Who were the Neanderthals?</i>

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,600
<i>What made them so successful for so long?</i>

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>And why, ultimately, did they disappear?</i>

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
The Shanidar Cave's
in the foothills of the Bradost Mountains,

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,240
but to call them foothills
doesn't conjure up the right image.

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,680
It feels mountainous.
It's quite jagged and precipitous.

30
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,640
Shanidar Cave makes an impression
just because of its size and its scale.

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,480
You have to approach from below,
and it's incredibly impressive.

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
It's very large.

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,400
It has a very wide mouth,
so it's very light.

34
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,000
You have the swifts
kind of flying in overhead,

35
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,240
and eagles circling above,
and wolves howling at night.

36
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,760
It's an amazing place.

37
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,800
{\an8}And to actually be the person
who's excavating that as well

38
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,200
{\an8}is extremely extraordinary.

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,160
<i>Emma is part of a team
of British archaeologists</i>

40
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,680
<i>invited by their Kurdish colleagues
to continue work in the cave.</i>

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,400
Shanidar Cave is hugely iconic
in the history of Neanderthal studies,

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
and played
a really pivotal role in us rethinking

43
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,320
what we assumed Neanderthals did,

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
and what they were like,
and what they were capable of.

45
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,840
The aim of the new project is to use

46
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,760
the whole range of archaeological science
now available to us,

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,240
to shed new light on Neanderthal behavior.

48
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,080
<i>The trench
has not been excavated since the 1960s.</i>

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>And since that time,</i>

50
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,120
<i>the way we think about our closest
human relatives has shifted considerably.</i>

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
We still use the word
Neanderthal to describe somebody

52
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
that's kind of oafish, whatever.

53
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,800
It's still used as a term of abuse
in common parlance,

54
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
"He's a real Neanderthal."

55
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,160
Archaeologically, they are more
and more similar to Homo Sapiens,

56
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,640
{\an8}and much of that rethinking owes
its origins to the work

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
{\an8}that Ralph Solecki did here
in Shanidar Cave.

58
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,320
{\an8}Ralph Solecki was born in 1917.

59
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
He died a few years ago at a great age.

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,200
He was incredibly tough.

61
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,160
He stood on a land mine
in the Second World War,

62
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
and, miraculously, survived.

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,160
He was clearly a very remarkable man.

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,080
It's not clear to me precisely
how he heard of Shanidar,

65
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,120
{\an8}but he came here, and he worked here
for five seasons between 1951 and 1960.

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,880
He laid out a trench

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,720
that went north-south
covering most of the floor of the cave.

68
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,160
Why the site became so well-known

69
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
is he found ten Neanderthal men,
women, and children.

70
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
At that time,

71
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
we were young.

72
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,640
I was approximately...

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,880
seventeen, eighteen years old.

74
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
The doctor taught us.

75
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,320
Many stones came out of the cave,
large stones.

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,480
They used explosives.

77
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,560
They found the Neanderthal skeletons.
It was a big deal.

78
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Their ribs and bones were thick.

79
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Their head was very large.

80
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Their hands,

81
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,760
everything about them was striking.

82
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,000
<i>This was Solecki's
first major discovery.</i>

83
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,320
<i>He labelled it Shanidar 1.</i>

84
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,320
<i>A skeleton from a species
very different to our own.</i>

85
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,000
They've got
rather more robust features.

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,920
Big brow ridges
and a rather differently shaped skull,

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
and we have this very rounded skull.

88
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
They're stocky.

89
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,280
We assume
they must have some kind of language.

90
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,960
The more we know about them,

91
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,000
the more it's clear
that they were much more complicated

92
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,000
than we thought 40, 50 years ago.

93
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,360
We call it
the tree of life.

94
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,960
Each human and each animal

95
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,080
becomes a branch on that tree of life.

96
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,800
We are one of the branches,
and the Neanderthals were another.

97
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
Somewhere along the line, we separated.

98
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
I truly feel

99
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,960
that I am sitting on my cousin's remains.

100
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,520
At the moment,
we are about 4.5 meters

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
from the surface of the cave.

102
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,600
So this is about 45,000 years ago.

103
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,840
This is the level at which we have

104
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,680
the burial or deposition of Shanidar 1.

105
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,080
He'd had an injury
to the right side of his head.

106
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
But also to the left eye,

107
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,240
which might well have left him
blind in that eye,

108
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,120
and might be linked
to some of his other injuries.

109
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,520
He was also paralyzed
down his right arm,

110
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,480
and had both broken
his right arm in more than one place,

111
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,680
but also, it seems,

112
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,560
that either had the lower part
intentionally or accidentally removed,

113
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,120
so, basically, had no right arm
from just above the elbow.

114
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
There were also other injuries.
He had quite severe arthritis in his knee.

115
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
Fractures to bones in his foot.

116
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,520
So perhaps in terms of, say, hunting,

117
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,880
he might have not been able to hunt
in the typical way,

118
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,560
but had survived to a relatively old age.

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,760
<i>The implication
of the new find was profound.</i>

120
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,000
The discovery of Shanidar 1
was potentially a huge shift

121
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,840
because it did suggest that, perhaps,

122
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,200
there was this element of caring
and compassion in Neanderthal society.

123
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>Here was evidence
of a severely injured individual</i>

124
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,320
<i>being supported by their clan.</i>

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,240
<i>And soon,
Solecki unearthed another body</i>

126
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
<i>with an equally remarkable story to tell.</i>

127
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,480
<i>Shanidar 3 was another adult male,</i>

128
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
<i>and he too, carried injuries,</i>

129
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,800
<i>including what looked like
a serious wound to his ribs.</i>

130
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,080
<i>A stark reminder
of the violent side of Neolithic life.</i>

131
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,400
<i>Remarkably, elsewhere in the cave,
more relics have been found</i>

132
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
<i>that offer a clue to Shanidar 3's fate.</i>

133
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,120
{\an8}These are some of the artifacts
recovered from Shanidar Cave.

134
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,280
So, this larger piece is what we call
a "core." Now, a core is a cobble.

135
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
Cobbles are, basically, rounded stones
that could be from the river.

136
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,080
Neanderthal picked this up
with the intention of taking off pieces,

137
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,120
either for this to become a tool itself,
or for the pieces that come off,

138
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,840
which we call "flakes,"
to be used as a tool.

139
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,480
All readily available in the Zab River,
which is about two miles that way.

140
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,000
So, I'm attempting
to make something similar to a spearhead.

141
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
What I basically do is

142
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
go along the edge

143
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
and take off smaller pieces.

144
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,800
By doing that,
I'm essentially sharpening it.

145
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,920
I've not removed that much,

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,960
but already we can see
that it is quite sharp.

147
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,200
So a spear point like that,

148
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,400
has only taken me
about five or six minutes to produce.

149
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,840
This is a very deadly weapon
used in the right hands,

150
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,040
and someone who understands
what they're doing,

151
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
and what they're holding.

152
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
One of the interesting things
with Shanidar 3

153
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,080
is that they had a puncture wound.

154
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,080
That suggests that this stone tip
to a spear, or whatever it was,

155
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
went in some distance into the rib cage.

156
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,640
It might well have punctured the lung
and caused a collapsed lung.

157
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,440
The wound to the ribs
is consistent with a projectile.

158
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,160
You can imagine
sort of a spear being thrown.

159
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
It could be a hunting accident.

160
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
It could be violence between people.

161
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,920
But what we can say is
that they did have this wound,

162
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,240
and that they had survived for some time.

163
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,640
And so that might suggest
that they had some support

164
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,000
and help to make it through the injury.

165
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,920
<i>Though severely injured,
it appears both Shanidar 3 and Shanidar 1</i>

166
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,840
<i>had been cared for
by the people around them.</i>

167
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,960
<i>This was a radical new view
of Neanderthal life.</i>

168
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,200
<i>And elsewhere,</i>

169
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,800
<i>more evidence of their behavior
had been found in a cave</i>

170
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,640
<i>far to the northwest of Shanidar.</i>

171
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,400
Every new evidence,
that you have about Neanderthals,

172
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,920
is actually showing you
how human they are.

173
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,360
But their behavior
was different from ours.

174
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,760
They lived in a completely
different world to our world.

175
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,760
This is part of the Krapina Collection.

176
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,360
They are around 130,000 years old,

177
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,040
and they are the biggest collection
of Neanderthals coming from a single site.

178
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,360
We are estimating possibly up
to around 80 individual Neanderthals.

179
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
You don't have their whole bodies buried.

180
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
You actually have just fragments
of each of those individuals.

181
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,760
So that is very unusual.

182
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,040
On the Krapina bones, both cranial,
so skull bones, and also postcranial,

183
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,440
you see a lot of, uh,
human-made cut marks.

184
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,640
What this is is a tibia,
and there is a possibility

185
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,920
that it was broken on purpose,
that it was smashed.

186
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,000
You can also see cut marks here
and even some other marks.

187
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,920
One of the reasons
you would maybe smash a long bone

188
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
is because it's like a container
of bone marrow.

189
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,400
This is a fibula that has
another interesting kind of marking

190
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
on the surface of the bone.

191
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,600
They were probably made
when someone was scraping off

192
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,040
the remaining flesh of the bone
or remaining muscle tissue of the bone.

193
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,160
As you would do

194
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,160
when you were just like doing the same
with your chicken bone at your lunch.

195
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,120
When you hear
they were eating each other,

196
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
you're immediately, like, shocked.

197
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,360
But it's also the question,
"What kind of cannibalism?"

198
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,080
What did it mean to them?

199
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,880
Look at this,
it cuts like a real kitchen knife.

200
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,160
- It's almost effortless.
- Yes, so easy.

201
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,120
Recreating the tools,
the ways to do stuff,

202
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,600
we are trying to go into the head
of those people,

203
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,920
and, you know, see the cognitive processes
that go behind.

204
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,040
So, what is different is
that we're just getting cut marks

205
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,920
close to the articulation sites.

206
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,400
And what is weird
in the human remains in Krapina is

207
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,960
that you are getting it
all along the long bones.

208
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,160
So as if someone
is actually scraping it continuously.

209
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Yes.

210
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,240
I cannot imagine, like,
doing this to someone I actually know.

211
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,520
So, this is the famous Krapina 3 skull.

212
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,440
It is the most complete cranial specimen

213
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,160
in the whole collection,
and it's the only one that has a face.

214
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,040
This person, we believe, was a female.

215
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,240
A young Neanderthal in her 20s.

216
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,680
What is very interesting
is that on the frontal bone,

217
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,640
you have a series
of something like 40 cut marks.

218
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,000
There is determination

219
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,800
to do 40 cut marks
slowly and very close together.

220
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,320
Even if they were consuming these bones,

221
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,920
I don't think it was
because they were starving.

222
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,600
It's actually deeply complex behavior.

223
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,560
Maybe by consuming the flesh
of the person they knew,

224
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,880
they want to get some kind of virtue,
something that they admired in this person

225
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,800
that they shared their lives with.

226
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,400
In the ethnographic examples
that we know of,

227
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,640
until recently, people consumed
their loved ones

228
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,640
because by consuming their flesh,
they're trying to take in something

229
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,680
that can continue on to other generations,
you know, it's some kind of legacy.

230
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,040
I cannot say that this was exactly
what was the driving force

231
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,840
behind this kind
of behavior in Neanderthals,

232
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,520
but it's another possibility.

233
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
<i>The way Neanderthals
treated their dead</i>

234
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,560
<i>shows us the complexity of their thinking.</i>

235
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>And nowhere is this better understood</i>

236
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,000
<i>than in Ralph Solecki's
most famous discovery,</i>

237
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,800
<i>Shanidar 4, or what became known
as "The Flower Burial."</i>

238
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,960
Now in this cave,

239
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,960
we have found nine Neanderthals,

240
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,680
of which two are most important.

241
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,120
{\an8}Number 1 found over there,
at the depth of about five meters,

242
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,760
{\an8}and one here, Shanidar 4,
found at a depth of about seven meters.

243
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,440
{\an8}Ralph Solecki was one
of the world's great archaeologists.

244
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,200
{\an8}There's no doubt at all,
and he was a great storyteller.

245
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,840
This seems to indicate, perhaps,
the first signs of spiritual evolution

246
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,280
and maybe the first stirrings of religion.

247
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,720
{\an8}The flower burial was one
of these seminal moments,

248
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
{\an8}because it was pretty well
a complete Neanderthal,

249
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,360
{\an8}which was an incredible rarity.

250
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,520
And it was sampled for pollen,

251
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,800
which at the time,
was quite a radical thing to do.

252
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,000
We had found pollen
extracted from the soil,

253
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,560
something like this,

254
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,400
and this pollen
indicates the eight types of flowers,

255
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,560
which we think
were interred with the individual.

256
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,000
He doesn't quite go
as far as saying,

257
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,600
"They conducted a funeral service,"

258
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,840
but that's sort of the way
that the prose takes you.

259
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,440
{\an8}"Someone
in the last ice age

260
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
{\an8}had ranged the mountains

261
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,840
{\an8}in the mournful task
of collecting flowers."

262
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,240
The public perception
of the Neanderthals

263
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
always was that they lived ugly lives.

264
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,920
They were ugly people.
They had no finer feelings.

265
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,840
They had no higher thought.

266
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,680
And here were
sensitive caring individuals.

267
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,880
And it made every front page,

268
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,760
because here you have
weeping Neanderthals gathering plants,

269
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,640
from the hillside around,
to honor their dead.

270
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,360
Here were
the first "Flower People,"

271
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,880
a discovery wholly unprecedented
in archaeology.

272
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,280
<i>In the years
since the discovery of Shanidar 4,</i>

273
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,040
<i>the Flower Burial theory
has come under fire.</i>

274
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,240
Somebody who's studying jirds,

275
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,440
which are little burrowing mammals,
a little bit like a hamster with a tail,

276
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,720
found that the jirds took
flowers into their burrows to eat them.

277
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,840
So, that was quite
a body blow in many ways,

278
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,840
particularly because Solecki had noticed
what appeared to be animal burrows.

279
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,560
<i>But the team have
new evidence that suggests</i>

280
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,720
<i>Solecki was partly right after all.</i>

281
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,120
This is a landscape which has
things like hyenas and wolves in it,

282
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,840
and leopards, even today.

283
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,680
If they just left a body,

284
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,040
almost certainly, something
would have come along and eaten it.

285
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,480
These are
basically whole individuals

286
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,400
that haven't had that done to them.

287
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,720
In some way, these bodies were protected.

288
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,840
My guesstimate is that,
probably, they were taking branches

289
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,520
and producing a fairly
unpleasant barrier for wild animals.

290
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,240
And bits of that vegetation and pollen
fell into the corpse's rib cage

291
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,840
as it became a skeleton.

292
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,040
The Solecki story, I think,
is a wonderful story.

293
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,560
I think there's enough detail
now in our understanding

294
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,080
to know that it isn't a correct story,

295
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
by any means.

296
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,120
But I think the idea of Neanderthals
caring for their dead,

297
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,560
of perhaps protecting them...

298
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,200
actually, that isn't that far,

299
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,400
in some ways, from what he said.

300
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,680
<i>Ralph Solecki made
his Flower Burial discovery in 1960.</i>

301
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,920
<i>He planned to return the following year,</i>

302
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,360
<i>but he would never excavate
at Shanidar again.</i>

303
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,960
<i>The Kurds are
undisputed masters of the mountains,</i>

304
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,520
<i>where the Iraqi tanks can't reach them.</i>

305
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,680
{\an8}<i>This is not
the United States against Iraq.</i>

306
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,800
{\an8}<i>Boom! There's a hit.</i>

307
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,960
{\an8}<i>It's Iraq
against the world.</i>

308
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,320
<i>This is what regime
change looks like.</i>

309
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
<i>Saddam has gone.</i>

310
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,680
{\an8}<i>Pummeled
by modern weaponry,</i>

311
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,640
<i>the cruel caliphate is now surrounded
by these troops.</i>

312
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,920
In the early 2010s,

313
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
because the situation
had substantially settled down...

314
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>The Islamic State
is meeting its end.</i>

315
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,480
...the Kurdish regional government
approached Professor Graeme Barker

316
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,920
to start new excavations at Shanidar Cave.

317
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,760
We weren't expecting to find
any Neanderthal remains,

318
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,960
and that wasn't the aim of the project,
it was to, kind of, enhance the work

319
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,360
that Solecki had done.

320
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,600
<i>So, it came as a huge surprise</i>

321
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,200
<i>when, in 2018, the team discovered
the first Neanderthal skeleton</i>

322
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,000
<i>found anywhere
for over a quarter of a century.</i>

323
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,760
The first thing that really came up
was part of the skull,

324
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,000
which was incredibly exciting.
It was actually part of the eye socket.

325
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,240
And it has
very clear Neanderthal characteristics,

326
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,200
in that the brow ridge
in Neanderthals are much heavier.

327
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,640
And directly under that, was the left arm,

328
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,840
and the left arm was kind
of folded underneath,

329
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,200
sort of across the body,
and tucked under the head.

330
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,240
<i>Modern dating placed it</i>

331
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,440
<i>amongst the oldest
of Solecki's discoveries.</i>

332
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,040
{\an8}I think we find 75,000 years ago
quite hard to conceptualize.

333
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,480
If you think about
what we know about written history

334
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,880
can seem like a long time,

335
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
and that's a drop in the ocean
in terms of the history of our species.

336
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,120
When you think what's gone on
in the world in that time period,

337
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Neanderthals have disappeared,

338
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,080
modern humans have colonized
the globe for good or ill.

339
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,400
Agriculture, cities, urbanism.
European colonialism.

340
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,200
The awfulness
of the 20th century.

341
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,560
Throughout all these events,

342
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
there he has sat...

343
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,120
...or she, as flat as a pancake,

344
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,480
under a great mass of rocks.

345
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,200
And we come along,
against all odds, and find it.

346
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,080
It's certainly
a generational find.

347
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
Completely out of the blue.

348
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,760
The skull itself was very heavily crushed.

349
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,880
So, actually, the entire skull
was crushed flat

350
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,200
and was probably two,
three centimeters thick.

351
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,320
Very fragmented.

352
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,160
And very delicate.

353
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,080
Even a brush stroke can make things
crumble and almost disappear.

354
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,520
So you have to proceed so carefully.

355
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,960
What is that piece?

356
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,280
That's the front of the mandible,

357
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,920
and most of the lower teeth,
but not quite all of them.

358
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,200
We removed it in small sections
with all of the sediment

359
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,760
to help keep it together.

360
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,240
It is very painstaking,
and that's for good reason.

361
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,680
You get one go.

362
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,240
Archaeology is,
by its very nature, destructive.

363
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,440
Once you've excavated it,

364
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,560
you can't do it again.

365
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,480
Those little packages
were then all brought back to the UK,

366
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,400
so that we can put them back together.

367
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,240
We have a small team,
but it's a great team.

368
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
People come from all over the world.

369
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,560
After cleaning
and strengthening the bones,

370
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,280
then I had the pieces,

371
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,800
and I could start to do the restoration,
which is a big jigsaw.

372
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,760
So, the first fragment
is like the easy part.

373
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,240
And then it gets more complicated.

374
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,720
You need patience,

375
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,760
because you have
a very unique specimen in your hands.

376
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,360
It's a lot of responsibility.

377
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,200
<i>If the skull can be reassembled,</i>

378
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
<i>then the team hope
to reconstruct the face of Shanidar Z.</i>

379
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,440
<i>And another part of the skull
contains yet more clues.</i>

380
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,040
Today I've been collecting
the dental calculus

381
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,640
that has formed on the teeth
of the Shanidar Z individual.

382
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Dental calculus is
an incrustation on your teeth.

383
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,960
{\an8}It's what your dentist goes
to remove once a year.

384
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,760
It forms naturally in your mouth,

385
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,000
and as it forms, it traps everything
that ends up in your mouth.

386
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,880
So, we're able to get a lot
of information out of this material.

387
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
There is sort
of this persistent narrative

388
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,880
that Neanderthals were high-level hunters,

389
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,840
who ate meat, meat, with meat on the side.

390
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,200
It's only been in the last 10
to 20 years that we've come to recognize

391
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,960
that Neanderthals
did actually also consume plants.

392
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,320
Knowing how to turn something
that is poisonous when raw

393
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,640
into something
that is nutritious and edible,

394
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,520
it is something
that you have to learn over a lifetime.

395
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,800
And if we take
modern foragers as our example,

396
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,480
then the people who specialized
in gathering knowledge

397
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,840
were probably women.

398
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,200
By reconstructing
what kinds of plants Neanderthals ate,

399
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,360
we might be getting a window
into the role of women in their society.

400
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,600
We'll never know their whole story,
we'll never know their name,

401
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,600
their hopes and dreams.

402
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,080
But it's fascinating
to be involved in a project

403
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,000
where you're bringing even just
a tiny sliver of their life visible again.

404
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,120
And you do wonder, "Who is this person?"

405
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,040
"What were they like?
What's their life story?"

406
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,000
"How did they come to be here?"

407
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,840
I find it very hard to translate

408
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,960
from what a skull looks like to what
that person would have looked like.

409
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
That's where the remarkable skills

410
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
of people
like the Kennis brothers come in.

411
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,040
Here we have the skull that Emma,
the data Emma, sent us.

412
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,840
We've got an almost complete skull,
nice complete skull, and it's printed out.

413
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,080
- So now we can see him.
- Wow.

414
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,560
{\an8}Who are the Kennis brothers?

415
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,960
{\an8}The Kennis brothers are two twins
who are fascinated by human evolution.

416
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,520
Let's see, look at this nose.

417
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,720
It looks a very Neanderthal-like nose,
but what we see is

418
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,480
that the other side of the nose
is very narrow.

419
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,080
We reconstruct
ancient extinct humans.

420
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,960
We try to show people

421
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,400
how maybe the early ancestors
would look like in real life.

422
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,480
- Big eyes, tall face, small nose.
- Big eye, yeah.

423
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,160
You know, like... spectacles, you know,
these enormous, big spectacles like...

424
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,080
If you put the mandible below it,
it looks like... uh...

425
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,000
We were very bad at school.

426
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,640
We didn't read much.

427
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,360
We went to the library, and we saw
some beautiful pictures of Neanderthals.

428
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,760
We see immediately those worn-down teeth,
<i>mamma mia!</i>

429
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,096
- Incredible teeth.
- Typical Neanderthal.

430
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,600
- They use their teeth like a vice. Yeah.
- Vice. Like a tool.

431
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040
That, we find fascinating.

432
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,560
How a face, an ape face,
could morph into a human face.

433
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,560
For us, what's fascinating
about Neanderthals is,

434
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,080
they've got an enormous, big nose,

435
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,760
an enormous puffy face.

436
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,000
Never in human evolution
did you see such a big, strange face.

437
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,560
So that's fantastic to see.

438
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,120
So, mostly we get skulls.
Mostly the skulls are distorted.

439
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,400
We're gonna correct the skulls.

440
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,160
We're going to make them
complete with forensic methods.

441
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,920
When the skull is complete,
then we apply the tissue thickness,

442
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,080
the muscles on it and the flesh.

443
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,840
We fill it up with a kind of skin layer.

444
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,160
{\an8}I want to make them human-like,

445
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,640
{\an8}not too brutish, human-like,
but not too cliché.

446
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,240
Yeah, you can come.

447
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,240
I hope that a lot of people
look at this face

448
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,000
and maybe look at how strange it is.

449
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,240
They had such peculiar features.

450
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,120
And that's so striking
because the brain size is same as us.

451
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,360
They are as human as us,
but still there are differences,

452
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,840
and that's fascinating,
why are they different?

453
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,000
It's such a kind
of parallel evolution with us.

454
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,576
- All right.
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

455
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,880
And why did one disappear,
and why is one still alive?

456
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,000
That's fascinating. That's the other us.

457
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>Historically, these "other us"</i>

458
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,040
<i>were thought to be
not as smart as our own species.</i>

459
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:48,680
<i>Only Homo Sapiens are capable
of imagination, creativity, invention.</i>

460
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,000
<i>But this prejudice has been shattered</i>

461
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:09,360
<i>by what was found inside a secret
and truly extraordinary French cave.</i>

462
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,840
First, we go
into this very narrow space.

463
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,200
You have to be really careful
how you enter in it.

464
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,560
Push your bag in front of you.

465
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
There you enter another world.

466
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,800
It is really unnatural
to go into the caves.

467
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,880
These are places that people fear.

468
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,600
And especially
to the very bottom of the caves.

469
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,120
{\an8}The cave has been there
for a very long time.

470
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,280
A million years, probably.

471
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,520
So that's also something that you feel
when you enter there.

472
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,240
A kind of environment
that knew already a very long history.

473
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,880
When you go a bit further,
you have these nice very calm lakes.

474
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,360
The cave is shaped by water

475
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,480
dripping in and forming
these very nice stalagmites, stalactites.

476
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,240
What's really interesting...

477
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,560
you see that
there is really a kind of pattern.

478
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,840
These are forming circles.

479
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,160
This is not something
you would see in a natural cave.

480
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,800
It's very constructed.

481
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,920
{\an8}We understood
that there were architectural tricks.

482
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,640
Small elements to wedge
the large stalagmites.

483
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,840
All of this is completely structured
and thought out.

484
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,040
For an archaeologist, it's quite unique.
There is no other equivalent to it.

485
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,720
In the biggest
circular structure there,

486
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,160
we have really a very nice hearth
made by stalagmites.

487
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,520
Here we have a thermal
alteration, but it's not the only one.

488
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,680
We have quite a few...

489
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,280
- Here we agree, that's the hearth.
- It's the hearth.

490
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,680
It's the hearth.

491
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,760
So we have several places here
where a fire was present at some point.

492
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,240
Number 38,

493
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,720
along the middle.

494
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,560
It's a bit like
what we'd do when we camp,

495
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,000
and we would take wood and make a hearth,
like, in a teepee form,

496
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,920
like a point form.

497
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,280
This is very exciting
because we can see traces of soot,

498
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,440
thermal alterations.

499
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,000
There is very black soot,
it's red, it's purple.

500
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,760
Obviously, in all traditional
or prehistoric populations,

501
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,200
we know that fire has a symbolic value.

502
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,360
We find on the ground
very small pieces of burnt wood.

503
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,760
So probably,
they come in the cave with torches.

504
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,400
If you are in the middle of the cave
without light,

505
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,840
it's really dangerous.

506
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,840
So, you need to communicate very well.

507
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,840
You need to master very well the fire,

508
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,520
the lighting.

509
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,760
So, the first idea was
to date these structures.

510
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,080
So, these are the cores
of the Bruniquel Cave,

511
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,200
and these cores tell us
really the age of these structures.

512
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,160
By studying six different cores,

513
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,600
we could come to a very precise age
of 176,500 years,

514
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,640
and this was really incredible, in fact.

515
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,600
One hundred
seventy-five thousand years ago in Europe,

516
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,360
there were only Neanderthals.

517
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,520
Bruniquel is the oldest construction
in the world that you can see.

518
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,360
It's very emotional
when you see these structures,

519
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,040
and, especially, when you know
that they are so old.

520
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,120
The recurring question
that keeps coming back is,

521
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,600
"What are the structures for?"

522
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,720
The circle
seems to be the world.

523
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,000
So, you are inside the world,
outside the world, these kind of concepts.

524
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,080
With Native Americans,
where you have these circles,

525
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,840
people are in connection
with higher spirits.

526
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,920
Is it the start of the religion?

527
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,720
This is a crucial question,
but which is really difficult to answer.

528
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,440
So more and more,
we tend to see in Neanderthals

529
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,200
a much older humanity,

530
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:38,000
which shares with modern man
more and more things in common.

531
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,240
And therefore with Bruniquel,

532
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:02,640
we increased this relationship
we have with an ancestor who is very old.

533
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,920
<i>The enigmatic circles
at Bruniquel are a wonderful part</i>

534
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,920
<i>of the ongoing reappraisal
of Neanderthal culture...</i>

535
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,120
<i>that began at Shanidar,</i>

536
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,480
<i>and which continues to this day.</i>

537
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,240
This year,
we found a few isolated bits

538
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,160
of what we think
could be a single skeleton.

539
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,240
We might have found another individual.

540
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,840
There's the left shoulder blades.

541
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,720
There's also a reasonably
complete right hand.

542
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,280
What we've actually found is four fingers,

543
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,080
more or less, in the place
they'd be in the body.

544
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,000
So, what we'd call articulated.

545
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,040
<i>The new remains
are amongst a cluster of bodies</i>

546
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,880
<i>that include
both Shanidar 4 and Shanidar Z.</i>

547
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,720
That's really exciting

548
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,720
because what it is
is evidence of Neanderthals

549
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,400
placing their dead
in this one particular spot.

550
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,640
Are they perhaps coming back
to that same spot on multiple occasions,

551
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,400
which could be decades
or maybe thousands of years apart?

552
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,360
So you start to ask,

553
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,400
"Is it just a coincidence, or is this
potentially something intentional?"

554
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,240
And if so, then, why?
And what's bringing them back there?

555
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,800
When Shanidar Z was buried,
there was a stone behind the skull.

556
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,280
And that is interesting
because it seems rather out of place.

557
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,960
And so an idea
we've been thinking about is,

558
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,920
could this be something
that's been put there intentionally?

559
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,800
Another thing that's interesting is that,

560
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,200
on the other side of the body,
you've got the big vertical slab.

561
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,080
Clearly, if you've got big vertical
slabs sticking up out of the ground,

562
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,640
there is a possibility that
that could act as some kind of marker.

563
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,480
So, it seems that certain individuals
were buried here,

564
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,920
and they're coming back
for that very reason,

565
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,320
and to this one spot, that's marked
by this very distinctive stone,

566
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,480
in what is a very distinctive cave.

567
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,600
It looks more
and more as Ralph Solecki

568
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,640
first found that Shanidar Cave
was a special place for Neanderthals.

569
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,280
They are placing bodies.

570
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,720
They're in a world,

571
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,520
in which they are coming back here
regularly and living here.

572
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,120
<i>The cluster of remains
are perhaps evidence</i>

573
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,560
<i>of a Neanderthal burial ground,</i>

574
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,560
<i>a discovery with deep implications.</i>

575
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,000
How people treat the dead

576
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:11,120
can give us really important insights
into thinking, imagination, emotion.

577
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,880
It perhaps also reflects
how we think about death itself,

578
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,920
and whether, for example, we believe
that there might be an afterlife.

579
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:32,480
It's part of a rising sense
of the complexity of Neanderthal culture.

580
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,240
But they're not here now.

581
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,440
<i>The burials are just
the latest traces of Neanderthal behavior</i>

582
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,760
<i>preserved inside this remarkable cave.</i>

583
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,080
<i>Yet, perhaps, the biggest mystery remains.</i>

584
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,920
<i>Why did a form of humanity,
that thrived for 300,000 years, disappear</i>

585
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,120
<i>forty-thousand years ago?</i>

586
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,480
<i>Perhaps the best place
to search for answers</i>

587
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,720
<i>lies on the shores
of the Mediterranean Sea</i>

588
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,520
<i>at one of the final strongholds
of the Neanderthals.</i>

589
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,760
Well, we're sitting
on the edge of a cliff.

590
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,400
{\an8}Very close to, what a friend called,
Neanderthal City...

591
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,920
because it's a whole row of caves
on the waterfront,

592
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,920
on the east side of the Rock of Gibraltar.

593
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,200
The Gorham's Cave complex
is a series of caves,

594
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,600
and all these caves show
very clear evidence

595
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,600
of Neanderthal presence
and occupation over a long period of time.

596
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,160
We have evidence going back
to at least 125,000 years ago.

597
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,840
<i>The team have unearthed evidence</i>

598
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,680
<i>that Neanderthals were using the caves
as recently as 40,000 years ago.</i>

599
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,200
Over the last 100,000 years
of their existence,

600
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,440
the world of the Neanderthals
was constantly changing.

601
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,200
The climatic changes were brutal.

602
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,400
They had been earlier ice ages,

603
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,120
but the last one, arguably,
was the worst one in terms of impact.

604
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,760
The Scandinavian ice sheet
really spread south.

605
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,120
France and Central Europe
were little more than steppe-tundra.

606
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,240
It really was a very harsh world.

607
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,840
The tundra didn't reach this far south,

608
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,880
but there were still obvious changes.

609
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,360
When conditions get very cold,
a lot of water is trapped as ice,

610
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,440
in ice sheets, in glaciers,
and the sea level drops.

611
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,680
When the sea level was lower
than it is today,

612
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,160
that would have exposed a large plain

613
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,200
where all these herbivores
would have been living,

614
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,080
where the birds would have been living,

615
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,240
where there would have been
shallow lakes with fresh water.

616
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,280
They would have known exactly
which species they could consume,

617
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,240
where to find them,
and how to best use them.

618
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,200
These are just
a very small sample of all the bones,

619
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,720
and all the remains
that we've found in the caves.

620
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,840
We've got tens of thousands of artifacts
that we found in the last 30 years.

621
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,720
They're eating animals
that are not expected,

622
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,320
{\an8}and not normally associated,
with Neanderthals.

623
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,880
We have evidence that they were going down
to the rocky shoreline

624
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,280
and picking limpets.

625
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,640
And, in fact, I've got a limpet here,

626
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,120
which has still got a flint tool
stuck on to it.

627
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,920
So, it's where the Neanderthal left it.

628
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,040
But then we get this particular bone,
which comes from a common dolphin,

629
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,000
and it's got cut marks on it.

630
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,280
Maybe the dolphin was dead already
on the shore, but they defleshed it.

631
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,840
They removed the flesh to consume it.

632
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,160
The Neanderthals thrived in Europe
for longer than we have been around.

633
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
That's for sure.

634
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,760
To me, that says that they're intelligent,

635
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,080
and that they understand
their environment.

636
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,920
In that sense,
they were extremely successful.

637
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,720
The Neanderthals were human.
They were resilient.

638
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,520
They were very much like us.

639
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,720
But, one day, it all came to an end.

640
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,040
<i>Which deepens the mystery
of their disappearance.</i>

641
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,360
<i>After all, if the Gibraltar Neanderthals
were so resilient for so long,</i>

642
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,800
<i>what on earth went wrong?</i>

643
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,960
People associate the Ice Age
with getting cold, which of course it did,

644
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,880
but it also got dryer.

645
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,880
The change that hit
these Neanderthals in Gibraltar,

646
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,720
in my view, was one
of a world of trees disappearing.

647
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,200
You have trees,
and why are those significant?

648
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,280
Because they allow you
to ambush hunt large prey.

649
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,280
Through time, their whole physique

650
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,360
had become that
of a wrestler-type build, if you like,

651
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,680
capable of jumping on top
of these animals with spears,

652
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,320
thrusting spears
and killing those animals.

653
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,040
Suddenly, that world becomes
an open landscape.

654
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,600
The animals see you coming
a mile away. You can't get near them.

655
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,720
When the change came,

656
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,240
it was so rapid that their biology
couldn't change at that speed.

657
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,320
And that's what hit them.

658
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,760
We think that we are
the pinnacle of evolution,

659
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,160
that's the way
we've always painted ourselves.

660
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,520
Even with respect to the Neanderthals,
we're here, and they're not,

661
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,200
because we were better than they were. Um...

662
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:00,840
But you can be very highly adapted,
you can do very well on a planet,

663
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,520
like, we'd argue,
perhaps we're doing today.

664
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,200
And yet, the story tells us
that there are other ways of being human,

665
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,960
and those ways can sometimes fail.

666
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,440
We might think we're doing
very well on this planet,

667
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,640
but just be aware.

668
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:32,360
<i>By around 40,000 years ago,
Neanderthal numbers were in free fall.</i>

669
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,560
<i>Not just in Gibraltar,
but across their entire world.</i>

670
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,800
<i>Climate change
was a factor in their decline.</i>

671
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,520
<i>But so too, was increasing competition
from another species.</i>

672
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:05,360
<i>To this day, all of us carry
a tiny bit of Neanderthal DNA.</i>

673
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,760
<i>A legacy of our long-lost ancestors.</i>

674
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,280
<i>For at least 100,000 years,
waves of Homo Sapiens</i>

675
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,760
<i>had spread from Africa
into Europe and Asia,</i>

676
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,880
<i>encountering Neanderthals
as they traveled.</i>

677
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,640
<i>Some of these encounters
may have been violent.</i>

678
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,680
<i>But some, presumably,
were more peaceful.</i>

679
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,160
<i>One group of people recognizing
the humanity of the other.</i>

680
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,960
<i>The path of these epic journeys</i>

681
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,520
<i>would have taken
Homo Sapiens through the Middle East.</i>

682
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:23,880
<i>Close to the ancestral burial ground
of the Shanidar Neanderthals.</i>

683
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,920
Neanderthal genes
are present inside many Homo Sapiens.

684
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,160
And I do really believe
that we are cousins.

685
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,920
We are of the same blood.

686
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,080
We have the same ancestors.

687
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,840
One of the things that I find
so fascinating about archaeology

688
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,440
is that diversity of ways of being human.

689
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,200
Looking at how people's skeletons are,

690
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:20,000
can tell us about their lives
and their experience of the world.

691
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,160
While excavating Shanidar Z,
we could see certain characteristics

692
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,800
that suggested that they're an adult,

693
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,160
but we didn't know
how old they were when they died,

694
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,440
we didn't know
whether they were male or female,

695
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,600
and we didn't know
a great deal either about their life.

696
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,720
So a lot of those kinds of questions
of what we are working on answering now.

697
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,200
What we've got here is the left radius.
So, this is one of the forearm bones.

698
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,040
We can tell already that this was
a relatively small individual,

699
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:02,400
between about one and a half,
or 1.55 meter to 1.60 meter tall.

700
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,920
That's just over five foot essentially.

701
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,640
Here we've got part of the lower jaw,
the mandible, with some of the teeth.

702
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,960
An important thing to notice,
is that actually many of these teeth,

703
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,760
especially the front teeth here,
are all extremely worn down.

704
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,840
That's the enamel,

705
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,760
that's completely worn off,
all of these teeth.

706
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,640
Certainly, we know that
for a Neanderthal with teeth this worn,

707
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,600
they had to be an older individual,

708
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,480
probably somewhere
between about 40 and 50.

709
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,280
There are ways that we can tell the sex
of the individual from the skeleton.

710
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,880
What we did was use a technique
called proteomics,

711
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,440
which is where you analyze
some of the proteins

712
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,040
in the enamel of the tooth,

713
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,400
because we know that there's
a particular protein that's produced,

714
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,320
while that enamel's forming,

715
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,560
that has a different version
that's encoded by

716
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,720
what's on the X chromosome
compared to what's on the Y chromosome.

717
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,360
So, that indicates very strongly to us
that this is a female individual.

718
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,760
Quite often,
we think of Neanderthals as males,

719
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,560
or we tend to focus on aspects
of male behavior.

720
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,120
This is a really exciting opportunity
to understand Neanderthal society

721
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,440
more completely.

722
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,840
I think to have an actual reconstruction

723
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,440
of what this Neanderthal woman
might have looked like

724
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,280
during life will be incredibly exciting.

725
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,520
- Well, Doctor Pomeroy.
- Let's find out.

726
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,240
- We have one already prepared.
- Hmm.

727
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,880
Yep.

728
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,760
I'm gonna start from this.

729
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,320
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

730
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,200
- Well.
- Well.

731
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,880
Amazing, we should turn
her round, so that everyone else can see.

732
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,680
Wow.

733
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,600
She's looking at me.

734
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,040
Yeah, she is. You've probably spent
the most time with her, so...

735
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,720
- Also, you remember the nose and...
- Yeah.

736
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,080
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

737
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,560
It's interesting
how they've done her expression,

738
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,360
I mean the emotions
that are wrapped into it.

739
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,000
I think that's the beauty
of these kinds of reconstructions,

740
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,600
is that some people are somewhat critical,

741
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,200
and say, "We can never know
what people looked like."

742
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,960
There's various assumptions
we have to make, and that's very true,

743
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:12,240
but... I think it does give you
a sense of her as a person.

744
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,320
Hmm.

745
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,560
She gets to the heart,
doesn't she, of what it means to be human.

746
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,760
What it might have meant
to be human Neanderthal.

747
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,080
Somehow, you do get something of the...

748
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,120
I don't know,
of a deep life history to this person.

749
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,120
{\an8}It's the older people,
with their knowledge, their experience,

750
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,440
{\an8}who would have known
where the good places were.

751
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,080
That memory, whether it was
only within her head,

752
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,080
or whether it was something
that was in her head,

753
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,280
that she was sharing
through songs and stories

754
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,840
with children and grandchildren,

755
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,680
would have been
absolutely vital to the group.

756
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:14,280
In many ways, that was the beginning
of civilization in a much more real sense

757
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,800
than the first time
somebody built a building,

758
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,200
or anything like that.

759
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,520
She likely had that, kind of,
role of a repository of knowledge

760
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,680
and had a major role in passing on
that knowledge to the next generation.

761
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,600
And here we are, 75,000 years later,

762
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,680
learning from her, still.

763
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,560
Shanidar Cave has taught us
a huge amount about Neanderthals,

764
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,040
and it still is teaching us.

765
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,800
But also, it's made us reflect on
what does it mean to be human?

766
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,320
Things like, having compassion
for one another.

767
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
How we deal with death.

768
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,280
And what's inevitably going to happen
to all of us.

769
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,280
Right now,
we're getting a snapshot,

770
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,920
and it's amazing and rich,

771
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,120
but we certainly don't have
the whole picture,

772
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,400
and there's much more there
to be discovered

773
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,960
about what we understand
"being human" and "humanity" to be.
